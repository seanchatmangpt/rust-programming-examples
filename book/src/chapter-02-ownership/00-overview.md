# Chapter 2: Ownership-Based Architecture

## Overview

This chapter explores ownership as a first-class architectural tool. Rather than viewing ownership merely as a safety mechanism, we examine how Rust's ownership rules shape the design of entire systems.

### Learning Objectives
- Design systems where ownership enforces architectural boundaries
- Use move semantics to prevent shared-state bugs
- Understand lifetime implications for system design
- Apply ownership patterns to real-world systems

### Sections
1. Ownership as Architectural Constraint
2. Designing with Move Semantics
3. Borrowing as Architectural Interface
4. Lifetimes in Large Systems
5. Case Study: Queue-Based Systems

Continue to the first section to begin.
